  I worked on a very large data collection effort, initiated by Nationalbanken, called Kreditregistret. My responsibilities largely consisted of identifying and building the tooling necessary for such a task to be possible in the first place.
  
  
  I worked with Python, PowerShell, SQL and PowerCenter.
  
  
  My personal highlights from my time at BEC:
  * I built an XML-generator in PowerShell. It turned out to be 10x faster than existing solutions, and this speed was absolutely crucial for the last step in the collection process.
  * Unprompted, I built a generic ETL-generator in python. This tool enabled all the flexibility from generic programming languages to be combined with the more traditional GUI-approach to ETL.
